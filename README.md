# ObfuscationProgramResourcesOriginalFiles
This repository holds the original files used in the Obfuscation program as part of a dissertation project.
All five files are basic computer science student assignment files chosen at random.

Each original file was then passed through an Obfuscation program to produce 5 obfuscation files.
The five obfuscation methods are:
1. Identifier rename (OM1)
2. Changing individual lines of code (OM2)
3. Comment modification (OM3)
4. Adding redundant lines of code (OM4)
5. Replacing control structures with equivalents (OM5)
